## Claim: The Catholic Church worships Mary as a goddess

~ False.  Catholics worship God only but give great honor to Mary as the Mother of God.

## Claim: The Catholic Church invented the doctrine of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in 1950

~ False.  The Catholic Church established the Assumption of the Virgin Mary as infallible dogma in 1950, but the belief that Mary was assumed into heaven, body and soul, at the end of her earthly life existed in the Catholic tradition long before 1950.

~ Written evidence of belief in the Assumption of the Virgin Mary has existed since at least A.D. 1095.  Furthermore, it is widely believed among contemporary Catholic scholars that the earliest fathers of the Church believed in the Assumption.
