## Claim: Baptism is not necessary for salvation

~ False.  Jesus Himself taught that baptism is necessary for salvation.

\block{
    Jesus answered, "Amen, amen, I say to you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit."
}{John 3:5}

~ Furthermore, the early Church believed strongly in the necessity of baptism.

\block{
    Without baptism, salvation is attainable by none.
}{Tertullian, \it{Baptism}, A.D. 203}

\block{
    There are three ways in which sins are forgiven: in baptism, in prayer, and in the greater humility of penance; yet God does not forgive sins except to the baptized.
}{St. Augustine, \it{Sermons to Catechumens on the Creed} 7:15, A.D. 395}
